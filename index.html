              <p>
                Solar panels are known to be the main source of clean energy to households.
                However, solar panels are very expensive and often difficult to install.
                By using solar paint as your new source of power, you no longer need to install expensive solar panels.
                Just like regular paint, the solar paint is easily applied on the wall, roof or fence.
                <b>The solar paint is cheap, easy to apply, and effective in most climates.</b>

              <h2>A three layer solution</h2>
              <p>
                Our solution consists of three different paints that are painted on a surface which is exposed to sunlight.
                A paint that produces electrical current from sunlight (photovoltaic paint) and a paint that produces electrical current from heat (thermoelectric paint),
                creates a combination that is more efficient than an avarage solar panel.

                Storing solar energy in local battery packs is expensive and inefficient.
                As an alternative to battery storage Solar paint have developed a flexible hydrogen storage solution.
                On sunny days when energy production is high, surplus energy is sent to our hydrogen storage facility.
                <br><br>
                Solar energy from your house is stored as hydrogen through electrolysis splitting water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen.
                Hydrogen can be reconverted into electricity using fuel cells when production of solar energy is lower in during winter or on overcast days.
                Solar paints hydrogen storage solution provides clean energy all year long.
